Answers to common frequently asked questions.

## What is Rocksky?
Rocksky is a decentralized, open-source (soon) music tracking and discovery platform built on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com). It works like [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) but publishes your listening history directly to your Bluesky account.

## What are the supported players?
Currently, Rocksky supports:

- ✅ Spotify (via API)

- ✅ any player with last.fm extension

## How do I sign up?
You don't need to create a new account for Rocksky. All you need is a [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) account. We use your Bluesky handle to associate and publish your listening activity using the AT Protocol.

## What is the AT Protocol?
The AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol) is an open, decentralized social networking protocol designed by the creators of Bluesky. It enables portable identities, composable data, and federation.

Rocksky uses ATProto to publish your listening history to your own feed, making it discoverable and shareable across the decentralized social web.

## Is Rocksky open source?
Not yet — but it will be open source soon! You'll be able to self-host, build integrations, and contribute to the project via GitHub.

Stay tuned for the launch announcement!

## How does Cloud Drive integration work?
Rocksky lets you connect your Google Drive or Dropbox account to access and index your personal music collection stored in the cloud. Once connected, Rocksky scans your files and tracks your listening activity — all tied to your Bluesky handle.

## Which cloud drives are supported?
Currently, Rocksky supports:
✅ Google Drive
✅ Dropbox

## Is my data private?
Yes. Your cloud drive data is never shared. Rocksky only scans audio files you give permission for and publishes listening activity (like "now playing" and scrobbles). Your actual music files stay private.

## Can I stream music directly from my cloud drive?
Yes! Once your files are indexed, you can stream them directly from Google Drive or Dropbox through the Rocksky interface.

## Do I need to re-upload my music?
No. As long as your music is already stored in Google Drive or Dropbox, Rocksky can access and play it — no re-upload needed.

## Are you affiliated with Bluesky?
No. Rocksky is an independent project built on top of the AT Protocol, the same protocol that powers Bluesky. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by Bluesky.
