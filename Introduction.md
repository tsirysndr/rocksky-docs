## What is Rocksky?

Rocksky is a decentralized music tracking service. It connects with your favorite music players and streaming platforms (like Spotify, support for additional sources like Apple Music, Deezer, Tidal, etc is coming soon!) and publishes your listening history (aka "scrobbles") to your Bluesky account using the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com).
