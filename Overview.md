Rocksky is a music tracking and discovery platform built on top of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/). Think of it as [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/), reimagined for the decentralized social web. Rocksky lets you scrobble your listening activity, explore your stats, discover music trends, and share your music taste ‚Äî all without being tied to a single platform.

üõ†Ô∏è **Note**: Rocksky will be open-sourced soon. You‚Äôll be able to run your own instance, build extensions, or contribute to the core!
